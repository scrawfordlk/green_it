# Week 2 - Computational Sustainability
- computational systems (hardware, methods...) have lately become more data centric over analytic, leading to higher consumption of power
- Particularly LLM:
  + LLM search is 20x more expensive than traditional search engine search
  + Text to image generation (~1000 pixels) costs around 3kWh
  + 1min video generation costs around 6kWh
- power consumption grows linearly with the number of parameters of an LLM (= its "intelligence")
- power consumption grows linearly with size of exit index (= number of used layers) - but the quality of generated code does not grow in the same manner. In fact, it rises very high with low exit indexes, but then grows slowly. (slower than linear)
- quantum systems can reduce energy consumption, due to evaluating more states in parallel compared to traditional computers

## HPC
- QML := Quantum Machine Learning
- batch computing: HPC cluster where each node has its own OS and allows access through one frontend node. This allows access to the huge array of CPU/GPUs that are needed for HPC.
  + chance: offload tasks to Quantum Computer System
- something about Quantum Mechanics, idk, I don't study Physics
- Potential: Quantum Neural Networks:
  + the Quantum Machine incorporated into Quantum Neural Networks
- Problems with QML

## IT Solutions to improve Sustainability
### SWAIN
- idk really what the point was

### Holographic Microscopy

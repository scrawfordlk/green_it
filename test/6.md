# Sustainable Neuromorphic Edge Computing
## Neuromorphic Computing
### Dennard Scaling
- Power use is proportional to its area
  + As transistors get smaller, power density stays constant
- 2x transistors, 2x faster switching, 1/4 power
### Issue: Von Neumann Architecture
- Limited bandwidth between CPU and RAM
- Intensive data transfer and high clock rates -> high heat
- Sequential Processing
### Neuromorphic Computing
- Inspiration from brain (low frequency, high parallelism)
  + Brain requires a lot less energy (cause low freq) than processors
- Von Neumann Arch:
  + Binary Input
  + CPU/Memory
  + Binary Output
- Neuromorphic Arch:
  + Spike Input (as Timeseries)
  + Neural Network (for both CPU and Memory)
  + Spike Output (as Timeseries)
- Processing: sequential -> massively parallel
- Program: Binary instrucitons -> Spiking Neural Network (SNN)
- Communication: Binary data -> Spikes
- Timing: Synchronous (clock) -> Asynchronous (event)
- Determinism: Deterministic -> Quasi-Stochastic
- NO von-Neumann bottleneck
- Functionality:
  + Neurons are excited by Spike Inputs and fires spike when threshold is reached
  + Neurons leak (no spikes lead to reduction of excitation)
  + Neurons have high Fan-In and Fan-Out connectivity
- energy-efficient
  + No spike -> not computation (no energy use)
  + Low (1-10%) firing rate
  + Cheap binary events/addition over FP-multiplication

#### Neuromorphic Hardware
- Digital
  + uses digital circuits
- Analog
  + uses continous electrical signals
- Mixed-Signal
  + combination of digital and analog

#### Challenges
- New tools/workflows required
- New algorithms for SNN (current have slow convergence)
## Edge AI
- Edge Computing
  + Instead of relying fully on cloud, have intermediate Edge Servers (or even clients) for computation
- Edge AI := Edge Computing in context of AI (ML,..)
- Layer 0 (Cloud) to Layer 6 (client device) classification
- Edge Servers:
  + higher data transmission rate
  + less computational power (less energy)
  + more private
  + low latency (responsive)
  + "Ultra Low Power Operation"
  + can use neuromorphic hardware
## Off-Grid Sensing
- Collecting data in remote regions
  + water pollution
  + avalanches, landslides
  + forest fires
  + agriculture
  + water distribution network
  + oil, gas
- Examples:
  + GEMS/Air: Air quality
  + MEGASENSE: ML to measure Air quality
  + SWAIN
  + TROCI: Water distribution, Power networks, Cyber Attack
  + EMSC
  + SLF IMIS: Avalanches
  + CTBTO: Monitor entire planet (ensure no nuclear tests...)
### Challenges
- Energy/Network availability
- e-waste
- Disruption to ecosysystem
### SWAIN
- Measure stations collect continous data at critical locations of rivers
- Send data to Edge Server instead of Cloud (cause network barely available)
  + Runs Watershed Model for local area
  + Communicates regularly with Cloud for model updates (needs very little data)
    - Cloud Server runs Watershed Model for global area
#### Distributed Model Synchronisation
- local models need to synchronise to form global model
- SWAIN shows that you can reduce \#sensors while still having low error rate
#### Neuromorphic Hardware
- Replace nodes with NM-nodes
  + Less nodes needed, due to high Fan-In (from sensors)
  + Sensors already use analog signals
  + SNN is similar to Flow of Water

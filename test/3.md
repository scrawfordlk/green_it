# Sustainable Security
- what is more expensive? Security or no Security?
## Side-channel
- Derive secrets from obtained meta-data
  + Side-channel? (Counting cache utilisation for profiling): No
  + Side-channel? (Same scenario, but infer crypto key from it): Yes
  + Side-channel? (Measure memory access latency with Flush+Reload): No
  + Side-channel? (Same scenario, but infer keystroke timings from it): Yes
- So it depends on how the meta-data is used
- Has often noise, though noise is just someone else's data
### Flush+Reload
- Scenario: Shared Memory between Attacker and Victim process
- Attacker flushes cache.
- Cache is empty, Attacker expects his access to memory to be fast, if the victim accesses it beforehand, otherwise slow
- So Attacker can infer keystrokes without any privileges by training a ANN on the data and predict future words
### Meltdown Attack
- Access kernel address and read byte
- Use that byte to access the element of an array which allows reading kernel memory
- Then check if any part of array is cached
- (No Side-channel attack)
### Solution: Kernel Address Isolation to have Side-channels Efficiently Removed (KAISER)
- patch for Linux
- Split the shared address space (User & Kernel)
  + User address space
  + Kernel address space
- Now you can't arbitrarily access kernel memory during user process
### Solution: Spectre-PHT (v1)
- Processor's branch prediction can lead to leak of key
## Rowhammer
- get root privileges using only JS (so any website)
  + imagine DRAM as rows of arrays of bits
  + at bottom is row buffer
  + copying involves transferring copied bits from an array past other rows into row buffer
  + Rowcells leak faster on proximate access
    - It is possible that accesses to row_i and row_{i + 2} affect row_{i + 1}, flipping some bits
    - so you can change opcodes, e.g. je to jne (e.g. reverse sudo check)
  + Solution: Replace error-correcting code with cryptographic MAC -> bit flips degrade performance with same security
    - This makes it so that if you decrease security, you also reduce performance
## Plundervolt
- by undervolting the CPU, the CPU may compute incorrect results (bitflips) causing faults
- using fault analysis tools, secrets can be extracted
### Green consideration
- generally: the worse performance, the more computers, the more energy consumption
- Spectre-PHT: fix: Browser site isolation (8.2% overhead)
- Meltdown fix: KAISER (5% overhead)
- in general, runtime overhead correlates with energy overhead
#### Maybe no security is cheaper than security
- instead run insurance companies
#### Alternatives: More security and efficiency?
##### SMTCache
- Have n slices as cache and have each process only access one such slice
  + Isolation => Better Security
  + More Cache => Better Performance (including energy consumption)
##### Undervolting
- Undervolting can actually improve performance
  + free energy efficiency at cost of security (Plundervolt)
- You could undervolt based on the instruction used (partition instructions into efficient mode, normal mode)
#### Security/Performance is an optimisation problem
- Reliability is just messed up security (where adversary is unknown)

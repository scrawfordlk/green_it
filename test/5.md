# Sustainability in Software Engineering
- To actually compare energy costs, programs must be runned and compared on many architectures
## Sustainable Development
- society, economy, environment
- Composed of
  + Sustainable Software
    - Develop efficient progams
  + Sustainable Engineering Process
    - Less compilation, minimise relearning of ML
- Green Software
  + Green IN Software (Engineering, Software itself)
  + Green By Software (Use software to do green things)
### GREENSOFT Model
- Sofware ideally meets 3 conditions:
  + Produced in sustainable way
  + Has minimum environmental impacts
  + Reinforces sustainable development (or at least not negative)
### Integration into Agile
- New role: Sustainability Executive
- Sustainability reviews
- Process Assessment (Sustainability of development process)
### Genetic Improvement (GI)
- Use Genetic Programming (or Genetic Algorithms) to automate creating sustainable software
- Use many test cases to make sure the evolved programs stay correct
- Mutations (0.5 rate) with DELETE, REPLACE, COPY operations
- fitness function can map to energy efficiency or runtime efficiency
- Reduction of 5-25%

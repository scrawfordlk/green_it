# Electric Load Disaggregation as a Means for Increasing Energy Awareness and Reducing Energy Consumption
- most computers are embedded

## Smart Meter
### Problems with Energy Bill
+ Much later than consumption
+ No info how energy was used
### Solution
+ More details on energy consumption
  - Analyse energy use for tips
  - Frequent Smart Meter reports
  - Prepaid billing (More conservative usage of energy to not exceed paid amount)
  - Interfaces for energy usage
+ idk what percent mean, but ranges in \[3.8, 12\]% and >12% improvement
+ So customers just need to be aware of consumption

#### Privacy Converns
+ Frequent measurement of energy consumption can infer devices and daily schedule
##### Private Smart Metering
- monitor own consumption
- identify energy hungry devices
- open technologies
###### YoMo
- Arduino Shield
- open
- low cost
- serve as interface between appliance and webserver, where it can then be visualised
- stays in household => private

###### YoMoPie
- same, but Raspberry Pi


#### Non-intrusive Load Monitoring
- Monitor devices with centralised smart meter
##### Load Disaggregation
- Split up power energy consumption into different appliances (think of the graph into graphs)
###### Idea 1: Model as knapsack problem: Set of available devices find subset that matches consumption
- Problems
  + large search space
  + ambiguous combinations
  + small power change may change results a lot
  + => works only for few devices
    - Appliance's Set Complexity generally grows with total power consumption
###### Idea 2: Particle Filter Based Load Disaggregation (PALDI)
- Markov Model
  + Each device has Markov process (FSM where different states have different consumption, e.g. "on" (20W) & "off" (0W))
###### Idea 3: Deep Learning: Model as classification problem
- train classifier using ML with training set (must be large enough)
- black box, but very good results (~90% accuracy)
- Problem: Models must be trained for each household (worth it?), or one model for many similar environments (over all seasons, frequent (e.g. 1Hz))
- Standardised evaluation framework: Deep-NILMTK Pipeline

# Computational Sustainability
- analytical approaches turn into data-driven approaches

## Actors
- Human
- IT
- Nature

## Methods
- Disruptive (Internet, Smartphone...)
- Tradeoff
- Behaviour Change (How to influence people to use IT differently)

## Energy cost analogies
- 5-50 prompts <-> 500ml water
- LLM <-> 20x search (2.9Wh/Search)
- Text2Image <-> 3hr dishwasher (3kWh)
- 1min AI-video <-> 36h PS4 (5 kWh)

## Trade-Off: LLM tools in software development
- 30-40% of code in large organisations is AI-generated

### Resource-efficient inference in LLMs
- Knowledge Distillation
  + Transfer knowledge of larger models to smaller models
- Quantisation
  + Reduce numerical precision
- Compression
### Correlation of Exit Index and energy consumption
- Higher Exit Indices (= number of layers) correlate linearly with higher energy consumption
- Non-linearly with actual code quality: First 5 layers contribute heavily, then grows slowly

## Disruptive: Quantum Computers
- 10^48 bits encode as much as 160 qubits
### HPQC Cluster
- Each node runs own OS
- Interconnected with network cables
- Access via frontend ssh terminal
- Certain tasks (linalg) sent to cluster may be delegated to QPU
### Quantum Neural Network
- measure and optimise the QNN iteratively
- Challenges:
  + Gradient Descent becomes ineffective the more qubits used
  + quantum circuits not actively contributing to learning wastes resources
  + not scalable
## Sustainable Watershed Management through IoT-driven AI (SWAIN)
- collect data from IoT devices + expert knowledge to create digital model of river
## Holographic Microscopy
- shine light through still water
- take snapshot of this water
- use AI to identify contents
- alert when identifying e.g. DNA

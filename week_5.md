# Sustainability in Software Engineering
## Motivation
- energy consumption depends on hardware and software
- worse algorithmic complexity may lead to higher energy consumption
  + depends on data structure
  + in general reduce number of statements
  + benchmark energy consumption

## General
### Green by Software
- use software to improve sustainability
### Green in Software
- improve sustainability when developing/designing software
#### During Development:
  + Reduce compilations (no nightly builds...)
  + Minimise learning in machine learning based software
  + Avoid using LLM software
#### During Use:
  + proper data structures
  + improve maintainability (the more, the less you need to work with it)

## Greensoft Model
- A sustainable software ideally:
  + way produced is sustainable
  + software has minimal negative impact on environment
  + reinforces further sustainable software
- Quality aspects
  + efficiency
  + reusability
  + modifiability
  + usability

## Genetic Improvement
- set up many tests that ensure the functionality of software
- then use genetic programming to modify the program, so that the energy use is minimised, while still passing all tests
- there exists a paper on this

# Morphing (?) and Edge AI
- Dennard Scaling

## Von Neumann Bottleneck
- bottleneck when trying to transmit data from memory to cpu and vice versa
  + limited bandwidth between cpu and memory
  + excessive heat due intensive data transfer

## Neuromorphic Computing
- Idea: Model the brain more, i.e. less direct cpu power and not sequential - instead massive parallelism
- stochastic rather than deterministic

### Spiking Neural Networks
- inputs increase the potential of a neuron body and once it reaches a threshold, it fires
- Advantage: only when input is available, does the neuron actually use energy -> energy saving when not using

#### Neuromorphic Hardware:
- Digital implementation using digital circuits
- Analog implementation using continous electrical signals to represent neurons
- Mixed-Signal implementation: combination of the two above

## Edge AI
- Mobile devices -> Edge Server -> Cloud Server
- The further right, the lower the data transmission rate, the higher the computational power

## Off-grid sensing
- environmental monitoring
- Uhl took some notes here (slide for bullet point above)
- ...

## Distributed Model Synchronisation
- Uhl took some notes here
